# mazes-ts

A translation of some of the code in [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/) into TypeScript with some controls to play with them.

## Usage

Run `yarn install`, then `yarn watch` or `yarn build` or whatever else you find in `package.json`.  Then open `dist/index.html` in a web browser once it's gone done and built itself.
